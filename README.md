Hello everyone!

My name is Christian Viktrup. My background is in Civil Engineering, with strong interests in clean energy, performing arts, and entrepreneurship! Recently, I've discovered my passion for programming. This is my first GitHub repository, and hopefully the first of many.

Thanks for reading!

Best regards,
